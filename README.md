## Reflection
The design files are available in the design-files folder. The layouts are pretty straightforward when implementing them separately, but while trying to achieve smooth transitions from one layout to another with the same HTML structure, I got kind of tangled up üòÖ. Therefore, I think the code could be a bit better organized and shorter. There might be some edge cases where a part of one of the layouts for smaller screens breaks and looks a bit weird. This can be easily solved with a bit more code and a few more breakpoints. However, on an average device, it looks completely fine. The dimensions I primarily tested for an average tablet device are 1024x768, and for a mobile phone, they are 360x780. Currently, I am satisfied, everything looks just as it does in the design files at the average dimensions, and the main goal of the project is achieved.

One of the main topics in the previous lessons was the accessibility. I understand it's importance, and I hope that we can have a fully accessible web for all.
